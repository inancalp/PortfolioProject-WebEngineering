                   <p>It’s Inanc. I’m from Turkey. Finished my first Bachelor degree - International Trade and Finance - in Istanbul, Kadir Has University. While I was studying there, my first travels outside Turkey has started. I have been around Europe and US to work, study and travel. Meanwhile I have started to explore myself more and find out that I don’t want the life, my degree is going to bring to me. So I have chosen a different path. After my graduation, I have gone to Australia and lived there for 2 years. I have worked in many jobs and traveled in my car for almost a year. Now I’m here in Belgium, studying at Thomas More to be what I really want to be!</p>
